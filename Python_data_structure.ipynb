    "1> Discuss string slicing and provide example?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answre:- String slicing is the process of extracting a specific part of string with the help of indexes of the string. String slicing is an important aspect of string manipulation.\n",
    "         String slicing can be performed by writing the string identifier and then mentioning the index number from where the slicing should begin and where to finish.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         The syntax for string slicing is:-\n",
    "             \n",
    "             string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "             \n",
    "                     Here, start represents the index value from where the slicing to begin.\n",
    "                           stop represent the index value till where the slicing will continue.\n",
    "                           step represents the number of jump values/ the index value to be skipped during the process by caluclation.\n",

    "2> Explain the key features of list in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- List are the type of data structure which are capable of storing multiple lines of elements in a single variable. Lists are mutable in nature, which means that list can be changed\n",
    "         or the items of the list can be edited. Here are the essential features of list:-\n",
    "        \n",
    "         1) Ordered:- The elements in list are ordered in nature. It means that the list elements have a pre-defined index to it unless it is explictly defined.\n",
    "                      When we define a new item to the list, it usally append to the end of the list, unless indexed.\n",
    "                      \n",
    "         2) Mutable:- The most important feature about the list is that it is mutable, simply mutable means modifiablity. It means whatever we want to change in the list\n",
    "                      we can perform the operation to change the list.\n",
    "                      \n",
    "         3) Allows duplicate values:- We can store multiple duplicate items in the list. It allows users to store multiple similar items.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         4) Multiple data type:- List can store multiple data types(string, integer, float, bytes and etc). It allows storing multiple data types into it.\n"
